Problem: Create a Responsive Photo Gallery Layout
Create a responsive photo gallery using CSS Grid. The gallery should display images in a grid and adjust the layout based on the screen size. You need to handle different screen sizes with appropriate columns and row gaps.
Requirements:
    1. Desktop Layout:
        ◦ Display the gallery in 4 columns.
        ◦ Each photo should have a fixed width and height (e.g., 200px by 200px).
        ◦ There should be a 10px gap between each item both horizontally and vertically.
    2. Tablet Layout:
        ◦ Display the gallery in 3 columns when the screen width is between 600px and 900px.
        ◦ Keep the same image size (200px by 200px).
        ◦ Maintain a 10px gap between items.
    3. Mobile Layout:
        ◦ Display the gallery in 2 columns when the screen width is less than 600px.
        ◦ Keep the image size (200px by 200px).
        ◦ Maintain the same 10px gap between items.
    4. Image hover effect:
        ◦ When a user hovers over an image, the image should have a simple scale effect (increase by 1.1 times).
